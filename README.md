This semi-maintained repository is aimed towards people that want to hack their own analog synthesizer using the XR2206 voltage controlled oscillator. 

It uses simple analog filter designs that are controlled using light-dependend resistors. The design is working but is kind off glitching out when using switching/unclean control voltages (ie when using an Arduino).
